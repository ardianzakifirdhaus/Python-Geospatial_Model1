        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This lab introduces participants to the application of machine learning algorithms for land cover classification using satellite imagery. Land cover classification is a fundamental task in remote sensing, supporting a wide range of applications including environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and natural resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we explore and compare the performance of four commonly used machine learning classifiers k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines, decision trees, and random forest classifiers. These classifiers are implemented using the Scikit-Learn library in a Google Colab environment, making the lab accessible and easy to follow without requiring local software installations. Participants will learn how to load training and testing data, preprocess features, train different models, assess their performance using accuracy metrics, and visualize classification results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use Scikit-Learn and Google Colab?\n",
        "- Scikit-Learn provides a user-friendly API for a variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN, etc.).\n",
        "- Google Colab gives you free access to a remote environment with preinstalled libraries, GPU/TPU access, and easy integration with Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goal\n",
        "By the end of this lab, participants will have a foundational understanding of how to apply and evaluate basic machine learning algorithms for classifying land cover types from Earth observation data.\n"

Next, prepare your feature matrix (X) and labels (y): X should be a two-dimensional array with shape [n_samples,n_features][n_samples,n_features], and y should contain the corresponding class labels. When initializing t-SNE, specify parameters such as n_components=2 for a 2D projection, adjust perplexity (commonly in the range of 5 to 50) to balance local and global relationships in the data, and set n_iter to control how many iterations are performed during the embedding process. After calling tsne.fit_transform(X), you will get the 2D embedding, which you can plot by assigning each point’s x- and y-coordinates from X_tsne and coloring them according to their label. Finally, customize the plot by adjusting the size of markers, transparency, labels, titles, and legends to suit your visualization preferences."
